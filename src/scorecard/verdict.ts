/**
 * Verdict engine (FR14, spec §4 «Логика вердикта»).
 *
 * A PURE function of `(results, thresholds)`: it reads ONLY `status`, finding
 * `severity`, and `score` — never `finding.evidence` (debug raw material). It
 * never throws and never mutates its inputs. `skipped` results are excluded
 * entirely (they neither fail nor warn) — the audit degrades on missing data,
 * it does not punish it.
 *
 * Priority order (spec §4, FR14) — FIRST match wins:
 *  1. any `status === 'fail'`                                → fail (gate / churn 2×)
 *  2. any `finding.severity === 'high'`                      → fail
 *  3. any scored result `score < hardFloor[scoreId]`         → fail
 *  4. any `status === 'warn'` OR `finding.severity === 'warn'` → warn
 *  5. any scored result `score < threshold[scoreId]`         → warn
 *  6. otherwise                                              → pass
